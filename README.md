# Diesal


Diesal is a library of ES20xx modules implementing common data structures and
algorithms. The goal is to wind up with clean, easy to understand, well-tested,
well-documented code that can stand as an exemplar. 

## Clean & Easy to Understand

No tricks, no hacks. Nothing that belongs in code golf. Sensible variable names.
Code should be minified before going into production; there's no sense in
inflicting that upon yourself. Code should be self-explanatory, and where it
might have to get a bit confusing, there should be ample comments explaining, in
detail, what is going on. There is also linting validation as part of the CI.

## Well-Tested & Well-Documented

`master` branch will always be at [100% code coverage][cv].
[Full API documentation][docs] generated regularly as part of the release
process.

## Tree Shakeable

Diesal is not packaged into a single, huge library. Instead, it's published to
npm with the source intact, so you can import only the parts you need, if you're
using a build tool that supports tree shaking (e.g. webpack).

# Running Tests/Coverage

`npm test` will run tests with Mocha, providing coverage info via Istanbul.
